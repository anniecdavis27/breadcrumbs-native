## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is a mobile GPS application for hikers and outdoorsmxn to keep track of their whereabouts. The premise, as the name suggests, is that such outdoorsmxn may log their starting point, end point, and drop pins along the way (regardless of the amount of cell service available) as if leaving a trail of breadcrumbs to ensure that they are able to get back on track in the event that they get lost.
